# Organice

#### This is a `project management web application` where users can create and maintain projects (implemented CRUD operations).
#### Under Each project multiple tasks can be created and each task can be moved across the board depending on their status â€“ New, InProgress or Done
#### Implemented Spring Security with `JWT Tokens` to authenticate and authorize users to login to the web application so that users can only see the projects created by them in the board with their respective tasks.

Exposure: `Springboot, reactJs, PostgresSQL, Spring Security, Docker, Postman`
